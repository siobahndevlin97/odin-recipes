    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a dish most known to be Garfield's favorite food. It is also my favorite food
        and I also happen to be fond of naps. <br>
        Lasagna is made up of pasta, tomato sauce, ground beef, garlic, and cheese. 
        It can also be thought of as spaghetti cake. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
